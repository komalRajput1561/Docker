● ps aux | grep docker : The command ps aux | grep docker is a Unix/Linux command
that lists all running processes and filters the results to show only those related to
Docker. The output of the command will show information about the processes that are
running on the system and include the user that is running the process, the amount of
CPU and memory resources it is using, and the command that started the process.
● docker-compose up : It runs all required dependencies and softwares in an isolated
environment called Container. So we need not to install dependencies again and again
when we want to set up that application in a new machine.
● docker-compose down – rmi all : we can remove the application and all its
dependencies by using this command. So we will remove only specific dependencies
required only for that application.It avoids messing up with the other applications.
● docker version : it displays version of installed docker version in local host
● docker run ubuntu : It directly load the image from docker hub and creates a container
for it
● docker ps -a : Lists all the stopped containers
● docker run -it ubuntu : It runs the image as a container in interactive mode.
● root@2f7098 : /# : 1.root - represents the currently logged in user . He has highest privileges compared to other normal user.
                     2.@2f7098 : It represents the container id automatically generated by docker and we can say it as “Name of an machine”
                     3./ : Forward slash represents where we are currently in the file system. It shows I’m in the current directory and it                         is the highest directory in the file system.
                     4.# : It means I have the highest privileges as a root user. If we have $ symbol means he is a normal user.
● echo Hello : It echos the message
● whoami : It shows the currently logged in user.
● echo $0 : It shows location of shell program
● history : we can go through all the commands we executed so far.
● apt list : To list all the packages in the Linux database
● apt update : To update the package database
● apt remove <pacakge_name> : It removes the package
● In linux we have hierarchy of directories which is like bellow :
  \ : root directory which is top one below to which we have standard directories like below
  bin : which includes binaries and programs
  boot : Which includes all the files required for booting
  dev : devices
  etc: Editable configuration files this is where we have all configuration files
 home : Home directories for the user are stored
 root : It is the home directory for the root user
 lib : it is used to keep all library files and dependencies
 var : Recently updated files are stored here eg Log files and application filesProc : which have all running processes
 So in linux everything is a file
